# Koda

Koda is a local-first coding-agent runtime and CLI under active development.

The project is building the control plane around a coding model: typed conversation state, deterministic model/tool loops, runtime-validated tools, append-only events, cancellation, recovery, and explicit security boundaries.

## Current status

Phase 1B adds a small, approval-gated file-editing slice on top of the Phase 1A CLI:

- Versioned Thread, Turn, Item, and Agent Event schemas.
- A provider-neutral streaming model interface.
- A runtime-validated tool registry.
- A model -> tool -> model agent loop.
- An OpenAI Responses API adapter with streamed text and function calls.
- Workspace-confined `list_files`, `read_file`, and literal `search_text` tools.
- A one-file `apply_patch` tool for exact UTF-8 creates and replacements.
- Runtime write policy, durable approval events, and terminal patch previews.
- SHA-256 snapshot checks and atomic same-directory writes.
- A single-turn `koda run` command with JSONL event persistence.
- Offline provider, runtime, CLI, and deterministic agent-loop tests.

Shell execution, deletion, multi-file patches, the Ink terminal UI, and sandboxing remain deferred. Workspace writes require explicit approval by default.

## Run the CLI

Build Koda, provide an OpenAI API key, and run one task against a workspace:

```bash
pnpm build
export OPENAI_API_KEY=...
node apps/cli/dist/main.js run "explain this repository" --cwd .
```

The model defaults to `gpt-5.6-terra`. Override it with `--model <model>` or `KODA_MODEL`. Runtime event logs are written under `~/.koda/threads` by default; set `KODA_HOME` to move them.

When Koda proposes a patch, it prints the exact replacement and asks `Apply this patch? [y/N]`. Use `--approval-mode never` or `KODA_APPROVAL_MODE=never` to deny all writes without prompting.

`ripgrep` (`rg`) must be available for the `search_text` tool. `list_files` and `read_file` continue to work without it.

## Development

Requirements:

- Node.js 22.20 or later; CI runs Node.js 24.
- pnpm 10.28.2.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm format:check
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
```

## Packages

- `@koda/protocol`: versioned runtime schemas and domain types.
- `@koda/agent-core`: agent loop, provider and tool ports, event ports.
- `@koda/providers`: OpenAI Responses and deterministic scripted providers.
- `@koda/runtime-node`: JSONL persistence and constrained read-only workspace tools.
- `@koda/cli`: non-interactive CLI composition root and console projection.
- `@koda/testkit`: deterministic clocks, IDs, tools, and in-memory event storage.

## Architecture

- [Architecture design](docs/plans/2026-08-26-koda-agent-architecture-design.md)
- [Phase 0 implementation plan](docs/plans/2026-08-26-phase-0-implementation-plan.md)
- [Phase 1A OpenAI CLI design](docs/plans/2026-08-26-phase-1a-openai-cli-design.md)
- [Phase 1B safe patch design](docs/plans/2026-08-26-phase-1b-safe-patch-design.md)

The model can propose actions, but the Koda runtime owns validation, policy, approval, and execution. User interfaces consume typed events and do not own agent state.
